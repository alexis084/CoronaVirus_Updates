# coronavirus_news_updates

A new Flutter application.

# Purpose
This application holds my favorite news sources that I use to stay informed about the Coronavirus pandemic, all in one place.
I found that keeping track of what is going on with the ongoing pandemic is difficult when you have many news sources that you like to consult.
It was a hassle for me to have to go to four different sites everyday to get my news. I decided to build an app to solve this problem.
This is the result.
